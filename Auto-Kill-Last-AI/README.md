# Project Name
```
Auto Kill Last AI
```

## Summary
```
Automatically kills the last AI in a group once all others have been killed. This greatly improve the player experience in PVE gamemodes where AI often get stuck inside terrain and become un-killable.
```

## Description
```
By default, will kill the last AI in every group by inducing a heart attack. 

Can be customized to make the last AI explode or get struck by lightning. 

Can also configure thresholds based on group size to kill more than 1 AI once a sufficient number have already been killed by players.

By default the thresholds are:

Group size = 0: last AI is NOT auto killed
Group size = 1: last AI is NOT auto killed
Group size = 2:	last AI is NOT auto killed

Group size = 3:  last AI is auto killed
Group size = 4:  last AI is auto killed
Group size = 5:  last AI is auto killed
Group size = 6:  last AI is auto killed
Group size = 7:  last AI is auto killed
Group size = 8:  last AI is auto killed
Group size = 9:  last AI is auto killed
Group size = 10: last AI is auto killed
Group size > 10: when 90% of group is killed, all remaining AI are auto killed
